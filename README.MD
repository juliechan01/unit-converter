I have setup very basic framework here.

You may run both front and backend from root using 'npm run dev'.  
If you wish th run only backend, use 'npm start' for node. OR 'npm server' for nodemon.  
For frontend. you may go to 'client' folder and run 'npm run dev' or from root, run 'npm run client'  
SEE package.json for 'scripts'
